Verify ID with DNA

It is now possible to verify original face via DNA with AI ! 

This app reviews DNA sequence of data with modeling code. 
App classifies original shape of a facial feature. 
Review of DNA and classification is based on neural networks and clustering.

My capstone is a pilot app that analyzes bird DNA instead of human genes as initial proof that this idea is possible.
A main goal of this app is to identify the shape of a facial feature based only on DNA. 

Originals matter!

I invite you to test drive my DNA app and see for yourself...cheers! And, of course, I welcome reviews of my app
